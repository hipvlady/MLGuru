## Overview
Welcome to the **ML Guru** content guide. I appreciate assistance from the consortium and community members for content 
creation and upkeep.

## Getting Help
The guides on this repository are meant to assist you in preparing for the job interview for the position of DS\ML 
Engineer. Please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn ([mrvlad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrvlad/)) with any 
questions.

## Content Update Workflow

To modify the portal content, follow these steps:

1. A Content Author creates or edits a markdown page to make the desired updates. Once the content is ready, the Content Author creates a GitHub pull request against the MLGuru repository main branch to request a review from the appropriate team members.
2. One or more Content Approvers review and approve the content, or suggest modifications. If the pull request is approved, it is merged into the main branch.
3. A Content Deployer merges the updated pull request into the main branch, which automatically deploys to https://mlguru.io/. Additionally, a release notes document is created to describe the changes made.
